Why do these birds stop here? The lake is an ideal habitat and is full of food. Hallam Lake never completely freezes in winter due to its 48  F spring water source. This provides a consistent, open-water site all year long.  At Hallam Lake we mark the seasons by visits from the birds. We count on their arrival just as they count on the safe haven that Hallam Lake offers",

The plants below are commonly known as horsetails and are a connection to an ancient part of plant history. Spore-producing horsetails belong to the genus Equisetum, in a plant family that is over 300 million years old!  They are also called scouring rushes because silica, stored in the plant's cells, makes them effective for scrubbing pots or polishing wood.  Native Americans used the horsetails as a blood coagulant, and more recent medical research has shown these plants to be an effective diuretic.  Can you think of other ancient plants or animals that are still living today?",
